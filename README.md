# Industrial-Safety-Belt-Monitoring-System
This repository contains the source code of a Safety Belt Monitoring System that I developed, which can be used for various Industrial Purposes, such as in Automobiles, as well as Manufacturing Industrial Factories.

This was completed as a project requirement for my two-month summer internship at AVISHKAR Innovation and Incubation Center.
